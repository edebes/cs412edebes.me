                  <div><p>My technical skills focus mainly on backend development, being that most of the languages I am
                      familiar with focus mainly on the more technical aspects of code rather than the user input and
                      graphic design of code, like websites. The coding languages I am the most familiar with are:
                      <ul>
                          <li>Java</li>
                          <li>Python</li>
                          <li>C++</li>
                      </ul>
                      I am most comfortable working through IDE's, though I am familiarizing myself with programming without 
                      the use of IDE's (such as through PowerShell and Command Prompt) for the case where I may not have 
                      access to anything but what is already available on a user's device. The IDE's I mainly use are:
                      <ul>
                          <li>BluJay</li>
                          <li>PyCharm</li>
                          <li>Visual Studio</li>
                      </ul>

                  <div><p>I am most interested in backend development, and hope to aim my career to focus on studies and jobs 
                      related to this topic. The main reason for this is because throughout most of my coding experience, I have 
                      largely dealt with coding languages and projects that trend towards backend development. As a result of
                      this, I have created a facsination with this sect of coding. This pull began as a fondness for video games, 
                      hoping that one day I might be able to be part of the process in creating one myself. As time went on and
                      I started taking Computer Science classes, that focus slowly shifted away from game design and more towards 
                      backend development as a whole. Another reason I drifted towards backend is the people who surrounded me. 
                      My friends and colleagues shared a similar fascination as me, and each of us pushed each other to try and 
                      be the best programmers we could possibly be, whether it was competing against each other to see who could 
                      get the homeworks done the fastest/with the fewest lines of code, or showing each other the small projects 
                      and programs we had made. My father is also a programmer, and watching him code growing up was very enticing, 
                      even if I did not understand half of what he was typing. For the past 4 years, I have held an internship at 
                      a company called <a href="https://www.realmanage.com/">RealManage</a>, where I worked for the IT department. 
                      Though it did not involve much programming, I worked closely with the system admins to help keep the servers 
                      online and to help solve issues regarding the network. Seeing all of the inner workings of the company software 
                      only bolstered my interest in backend development, and my motivation has only grown since.<br><br>
