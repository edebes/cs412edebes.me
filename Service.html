            <div>
              <p>I participated in <a href="https://www.scouting.org/">Boy Scouts</a> growing up, and achieved my Eagle rank, which is the highest 
              rank you can achieve. In order to earn this rank (among earning the required merit badges), you must complete 
              an Eagle project, in which you create a structure or service that in some way benefits the community. For my 
              project, I built French Horn shields for my high school band. What these shields do is reflect the sound of 
              the horn out to the audience, since the sound is typically projecting backwards. This project took a lot planning 
              and management, from ordering the supplies to recruiting others to help build them to organizing a day for 
              everyone to come together and build them. In the end, the shields were built and delivered to the band, where 
              they are still being used to this day.</p>

              <div>
                <p>As part of my church (<a href="https://stphilipsfrisco.org/">St. Philips</a>), we regularly organize mission 
                trips to areas that are in need of help, such as areas that were recently hit by natural disasters. For several 
                of our trips, we traveled to Rockport, TX (located on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico) to assist with the cleanup 
                efforts from <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hgx/hurricaneharvey">Hurricane Harvey</a>. The year that it hit, we 
                went down and built a ramp for a couple who were unable to walk but lived in an elevated house, so when the hurricane 
                hit, it destroyed their path of getting out of the house. We were able to get the ramp built in a week, and they were 
                finally able to leave their house for the first time since the storm. The next year, we went back to continue the cleanup 
                as a result of there still being a lot of damaged structures and debris. This time, we helped organize and 
                renovate a charity location for supplying food and clothes to those who had been displaced during the storm and 
                could not find other living situations. We were able to successfully organize the contents of the house so the 
                process of assisting others could be streamlined.</p>

            <div>
              <p>I have participated in several events hosted by <a href="https://www.fmsc.org/">Feed My Starving Children</a>, where 
              we package food away for those who are in need of it. We will gather in a large room and form assembly lines, with 
              some handling the food assembly, some packaging the food away, and some taking the food boxes away to be 
              shipped to other countries. Often times, I was on packaging duty since the food handling was meant for more experienced 
              workers who knew how to make it without contaminating it, and the carrying of the boxes was often done by lifters and 
              older men. Though I felt like I had a small role in the whole process, I know that what was being done could not have 
              been done by just a few people, and every part of the process mattered, as the more people we had, the more food 
              we were able prepare and ship out.</p>
