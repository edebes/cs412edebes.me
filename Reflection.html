          <div><p>The company industry day presentation for CMA CGM was very informative and varied.
             The main presentation was split into four parts, each lasting 30 minutes with different speakers.
             The first segment focused on introducing the company and its history. They are a company that
             began as an international shipping company between France and the rest of the world and began
             expanding their reach, acquiring new companies, and researching/developing new technologies to
             improve their productivity. Seeing the progress the company has made in the past 30 years, along
             with what the company has acquired through its merging and alliances of several companies, was
             impressive. Something I thought was interesting was that the company is large enough to sponsor the local soccer team.</p> 

            <p>The next segment focused on efforts in decarbonisation, stating its several ventures
             into creating sustainable reusable energy. It has pioneered the use of biofuels for cargo ships, which
             has reduced the CO2 emissions per container ship in the EU by 50% over the past 15 years. Their main goal is
             to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. I found it interesting that they are going through such lengths to lower
             carbon emissions, and am glad to see the progress they are making. I hope that their efforts will reach companies
             in the US, so that they will follow in their footsteps.</p>

            <p>The third segment focused on research and development, as well as internships within the company. This segment
             did not have slides to follow along with, but they did talk about their startup support that they host. In
             this program, they take on several different startup companies and projects and give them the resources they
             need to make their goals a reality. In most cases these companies and projects end in success, but there are
             some cases where they must be canceled due to lack of success. I like how they are willing to support so many
             startups that may have struggled getting their footing or funding otherwise, and I appreciate that their
             internship program seems fairly accommodating and educational, though it is unfortunate that the internships
             are only available at the Marseille corporate headquarters.</p>

            <p>The final segment was more focused on the cloud computing and cloud standards used and emphasized by the
             company. They discussed how they have begun adopting cloud computing into their company as the concept of
             cloud computing grows, as well as where they have implemented its applications. They shared how their database
             of customers and resources have been digitized and stored in the cloud, where they can be more easily maintained
             and accessible. They have also created applications that allow customers to see exactly where their shipments
             are at all times. It was good to see them talk about their use of cloud computing and how they have upheld the
             standards imposed by NIST, IEEE, and other such established groups. The presentation seemed mostly geared towards
             the solid mechanics group, so it was good to see them appealing to the cloud computing students as well.</p></div>
