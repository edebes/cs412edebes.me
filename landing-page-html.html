        <div><p>Howdy! My name is Eric Debes, and I am a Computer Science Major. I have several years worth of experience with coding,
           and the languages I excel with are C++, Java, and Python. What I am planning on focusing my career on is backend development
           and cybersecurity, though I would like to try my hand at video game development as well. I like to rock climb in my spare
           time, as well as play the trumpet and play video games. I have played the trumpet for the past 10 years, and have consistently
           placed in the top band for each of the programs I have taken part in. Currently, I am a part of the 
           <a href="https://12thman.com/sports/2015/3/23/GEN_20140101165">Hullabaloo band</a>, where I play second trumpet at non-football 
           Texas A&M sports games. I am a part of several clubs, some of which are academic (including the 
           <a href="https://www.aggiecodingclub.com/">Aggie Coding Club</a> and <a href="https://cybr.club/">Cyber Security Club</a>) and 
           others that are recreational (such as the <a href="https://www.tamutabletop.com/">Tabletop Troupe</a> and 
           <a href="https://getinvolved.tamu.edu/org/tamuocr">Obstacle Course Club</a>). Earlier this year, I took part in the Chillennium 
           Game Jam, where my team and I competed to make a video game in 48 hours. Though the competition was tough, the experience of 
           working with others on a schedule towards a common goal was quite enjoyable and educational. For the past 4 years, I have 
           held an internship at a company called RealManage, where I worked in the IT department to help out workers around the country when 
           any issues arose. Some of these issues included account login credential resets, adding new users to the company network and 
           setting up their accounts, removing old users from the system, and hardware maintenance (such as printer issues and 
           monitor/docking station problems). This past summer, the IT department expanded and added several new workers, and I took part 
           in training them on how to use the company software, as well as informing them of the different types of issues that they would be dealing with.</p></div>
